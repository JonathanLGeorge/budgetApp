Event bubbling 
============================
<main>
    <selection>
        <p>blablabla</p>
        <p>
        blablablablabla
        <button>Link</button>
        .   
        </p>
    </selection>
</main>
===============================


Event bubbling
    when an event is trigered on som DOM element. 
    like clicking on our button...
    then the exact same element is triggered on all of or parent elements 1 at a time
    so.... <button> ----> <p> ----> <selection> -----> <main> ------> all the way to the root

target Element
    in this example the <button> that is clicked  is the target element
    this target element is stored as an event in the event object
    sp... all the parent elements will know the target of the event

event delegation 
    if event bubbles up the DOM tree, and we know where the event was triggered 
    then we can assign an event handler to the parent and wait for the event to bubble up 
    then do whatever you intend to do with target element 
    in this example we can add event handler to the <main> element 


    why would we want to use event deligation?

    1. When we have an element with lots odf child elements that we are intrested in;

    2. When we want an event handler attached to an element that is not in th DOM when our page is loaded.
